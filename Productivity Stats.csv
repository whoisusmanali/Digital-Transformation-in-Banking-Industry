"Table Corrections:"
Date,Note
"2021-05-27","On May 27, 2021, corrections were mainly made to the compensation of employees series (including its related measures)  for the industries at a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 2-, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-digit level of aggregation for the year 2020. The related measures are total compensation for all jobs, total compensation per job, total compensation per hour worked, employee's compensation per hour worked unit labour cost, unit labour cost in US dollars, and labour share. Corrections were also made to growth rates for these variables in the goods-producing businesses and the service-producing businesses. Territorial and provincial estimates for the total economy, business sector and non-business sector, estimates for labour productivity and the 5 other related variables (including hours worked and real value added) at the aggregate and industry levels, as well as data for years prior to 2020 were not affected."
"2020-08-25","On August 25, 2020, corrections were mainly made to the labour data series for the industries at a North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) 4-digit level of aggregation from 2018 to 2019. Territorial and provincial estimates for the total economy, business sector and non-business sector, estimates for 2 and 3-digit NAICS industries, and industrial aggregations, as well as data for years prior to 2018 were not affected."



Footnotes:
1,"This table replaces CANSIM tables 383-0029 and 383-0030, which are now archived. For concepts, methods and sources, see http://www.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/5103-eng.htm. Data by industry included in this table correspond to the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts input-output detailed level of aggregation. The table is built around the Input-Output Industry Classification (IOIC). This one identifies both Institutional Sectors and Industries based on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS). The alphanumeric codes appearing in square brackets besides each industry title represent the IOIC identification code. The first two characters of the IOIC alphanumeric codes represent the sector. IOIC codes beginning with a BS represent Business Sector industries, codes beginning with an NP represent Non-Profit Institutions Serving Household (NPISH) Sector industries, and codes beginning with a GS represent Government Sector industries. The IOIC is a hierarchical classification. IOIC codes consisting of four alpha-numeric characters represent industries at the Summary (S) level of aggregation, IOIC codes consisting of five or six alpha-numeric characters represent industries at the Medium (M) and IOIC codes consisting of eight alpha-numeric characters represent industries at the Detailed (D) level of aggregation. The classifications of the Input-Output tables can be found at the following link http://www.statcan.gc.ca/nea-cen/hr2012-rh2012/data-donnees/aggregation-agregation/aggregation-agregation-eng.htm."
2,"Provincial and territorial data are available from 1997."
3,"Estimates of labour statistics associated with the geographic entity "Outside Canada" are not included in this table, but are included in the national estimates. They are published in another table (Table 36-10-0489-01).  As a result, the totals for Canada in this table do not correspond to the sum of its provinces and territories."
4,"Labour productivity is the ratio between real value added and hours worked. Real value added for each industry and each aggregate is constructed from a Fisher chain index."
5,"The North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) is an industry classification system triggered by the North American Free Trade Agreement, that was developed by the statistical agencies of Canada, Mexico and the United States. It is designed to provide common definitions of the industrial structure of the three countries and a common statistical framework to facilitate the analysis of the three economies. NAICS is based on supply side or production oriented principles, to ensure that industrial data, classified to NAICS, is suitable for the analysis of production related issues such as industrial performance. Since 1997, the industry classification system of the Canadian System of Macroeconomic Accounts input-output tables is based on NAICS. In the Macroeconomic Accounts industries, the levels of the different classification systems were chosen so as to provide the most detail possible in order to maximize continuity with the previous classification systems developed by Statistics Canada since 1961. For more details, see http://www.statcan.gc.ca/imdb-bmdi/5103-eng.htm."
